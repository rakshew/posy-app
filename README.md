Posy: Journaling helps. You don't do it—takes too long. Posy takes 30 seconds. Pick a flower matching your emotion, add notes/checklists/images. Track visually, revisit anytime, accept every feeling. Your digital blooms become shareable bouquets you can order as real flowers. Self-care that actually sticks. 🌸
